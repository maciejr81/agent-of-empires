# Web Dashboard Development

Contributor notes for building, running, and hacking on the web dashboard. End users do not need any of this; the dashboard ships in every release binary. See the [Web Dashboard guide](../guides/web-dashboard.md) for how to launch and use it.

## Building from source

The dashboard needs the `serve` Cargo feature and Node.js/npm:

```bash
cargo build --release --features serve
```

The build automatically runs `npm install && npm run build` in the `web/` directory to compile the React frontend. The output is embedded in the binary, so there are no separate files to deploy. A plain `cargo build` (without `--features serve`) needs no JS tooling and produces a TUI-only binary.

## One-command development

On Unix, `cargo xtask dev` is the fastest inner loop. It builds the serve binary, then runs `aoe serve` (port 8081) and the Vite dev server (port 5173, with HMR) together, pointing Vite at the backend via `VITE_PROXY` so `/api` and the `/sessions/*/ws` relays resolve:

```bash
cargo xtask dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
# Ctrl-C stops both processes
```

Pass `--watch` to auto-rebuild the Rust backend when you edit it:

```bash
cargo xtask dev --watch
```

It watches `src/**`, `Cargo.toml`, and `Cargo.lock`. On a change it runs `cargo build --features serve` and restarts `aoe serve` if the build succeeds; a failed build keeps the running backend up and prints the error. The Vite dev server stays up throughout (frontend HMR is unaffected), so the browser reconnects through the proxy once the backend is back. The restart drops live terminal and cockpit WebSocket connections, which is fine for a dev loop. Unix-only, same as the base command.

## Manual frontend development

If you prefer to run the pieces by hand, the React frontend lives in `web/`:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev     # Vite dev server with HMR on port 5173
```

For API/WebSocket requests, run the Rust server simultaneously:

```bash
cargo run --features serve -- serve
```

To work on the frontend against a "production" backend instead of a local build, set `VITE_PROXY` (shell env or `web/.env`) to that `aoe serve` origin, including a non-cargo install on a custom port, and the dev server forwards `/api` and `/sessions/*/ws` (terminal + structured view) there:

```bash
VITE_PROXY=http://localhost:50106 npm run dev
```

Without it the dev server behaves as before; HMR is unaffected either way.

## Architecture

The server embeds an axum web server that serves the React frontend and provides:

- REST API for session listing and control (`/api/sessions`); see the [HTTP API Reference](../api.md) for the orchestration endpoints (`send`, `output`)
- WebSocket PTY relay for terminal streaming (`/sessions/:id/ws`)
- Token-based authentication via cookie, query parameter, or WebSocket protocol header
- Rate limiting, token rotation, and device tracking
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy)

Each terminal connection spawns `tmux attach-session` inside a PTY and relays the raw byte stream bidirectionally over WebSocket. This gives the browser a real terminal experience identical to SSH, and is why sessions survive browser crashes and network drops.
